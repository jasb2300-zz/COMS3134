COMS 3134: Data Structures in Java

This repository contains various projects I worked on as a student in COMS 3134 Data Structures in Java in Spring 2017. During this course we discussed elementary data structures used in object-oriented programming and their implementations in Java 8. We completed units on lists, stacks, queues, heaps, hashcodes, sorting, and graph theory.

The programming assignments for this course were all written in Java.
