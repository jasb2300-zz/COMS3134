Homework 5 - README

I do not claim authorship of Vertex.java, Edge.java, Display.java. This code was provided to us by the Teaching Assistants to narrow the
scope of our assignment. 

Please compile all .java files in the command line like the following:

$ javac Dijkstra.java
$ javac Display.java

If the Edge.java and Vertex.java files have not been compiled after these commands, please compile them like the following:

$ javac Vertex.java
$ javac Edge.java

You can run Display.java and Dijkstra.java like this:

$ java Display
$ java Dijkstra

Thank you.
